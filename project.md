# **Building an AI-Powered 10-K Analysis System for Fintech: From Manual Research to Intelligent Document Analysis**

## **The Challenge: Drowning in Financial Documents**

Fintech companies face a critical bottleneck when analyzing public companies for investment decisions or competitive research. The culprit? SEC 10-K filings – comprehensive annual reports that average over 80 pages of dense, unstructured text containing crucial information about company financials, operational risks, and strategic initiatives.

The traditional approach requires analysts to manually comb through these documents, spending hours searching for specific information to answer questions like:

* "What are the company's main cybersecurity risk factors?"  
* "How has revenue changed over the past three years and what's driving growth?"  
* "What's the company's ESG strategy for addressing climate change?"

This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to missing critical details buried within the vast amount of information. The industry needed a solution that could intelligently extract and synthesize relevant information from these complex financial documents.

## **The Solution: A Multi-Layered RAG System**

To tackle this challenge, I developed a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms how fintech professionals interact with 10-K filings. The system creates an intelligent interface where users can ask natural language questions and receive comprehensive, grounded answers extracted directly from the SEC documents.

### **Why Traditional Long-Context Approaches Fall Short**

At first glance, this might seem like a straightforward long-context question-answering task – simply pass the entire 10-K filing and the user query to a large language model. However, this approach has significant limitations:

1. **Context Length Constraints**: Even the most advanced models struggle with extremely long contexts  
2. **Performance Degradation**: Models are known to perform poorly on long-context Q\&A tasks  
3. **Irrelevant Information**: Processing the entire document includes substantial noise that can confuse the model

The solution required a more nuanced approach: intelligently selecting and presenting only the most relevant information to the language model.

## **Technical Architecture: Building Intelligence Layer by Layer**

### **Layer 1: Smart Document Chunking and Table Processing**

The foundation of the system begins with sophisticated document preprocessing. Traditional chunking approaches work well for continuous text but struggle with the mixed content typical in 10-K filings, which contain both narrative sections and complex financial tables.

**Text Processing**: The system divides long documents into manageable chunks that maintain semantic coherence while staying within optimal size limits for embedding models.

**Table Intelligence**: Financial documents are rich with tabular data that traditional chunking can't handle effectively. To address this, I integrated the Unstructured library to extract tables in HTML format, then employed a language model to convert these tables into natural language explanations. This approach ensures that critical financial data in tables becomes searchable and retrievable alongside textual information.

**Vector Storage**: Both text chunks and table explanations are converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database, creating a unified searchable knowledge base.

### **Layer 2: Intelligent Retrieval with Cosine Similarity**

The retrieval system uses cosine similarity between query embeddings and document chunk embeddings to identify relevant sections. This process effectively narrows down thousands of potential chunks to a manageable set of 10-20 most relevant pieces.

However, cosine similarity retrieval, while effective for initial filtering, can be somewhat coarse in its relevance assessment.

### **Layer 3: Precision Reranking**

To address the limitations of cosine similarity, I implemented a reranking layer. The initially retrieved 10-20 chunks are passed through a specialized reranker model that provides more nuanced relevance scoring. This step is crucial because language models are sensitive to information order – more relevant content should appear first in the context.

The reranker understands semantic relationships more deeply than simple cosine similarity, resulting in better-ordered, more relevant information being presented to the final answer generation stage.

### **Layer 4: Query Decomposition for Complex Questions**

Real-world financial queries are often complex and multi-faceted. A single embedding may not capture all aspects of a sophisticated question, potentially leading to incomplete retrievals.

To solve this, I implemented query decomposition using a language model to break down complex user queries into multiple simpler sub-queries. The system then:

1. Processes each sub-query through the retrieval and reranking pipeline  
2. Gathers relevant chunks for each aspect of the original question  
3. Combines information to provide comprehensive answers

This approach ensures that complex, multi-part questions receive thorough coverage rather than partial answers.

### **Layer 5: Web Integration with REACT Agents**

10-K filings, while comprehensive, don't contain all information needed for thorough financial analysis. Market conditions, recent news, or comparative industry data often require external sources.

I developed a REACT (Reasoning and Acting) agent that intelligently decides when to search the web and formulates appropriate search queries. This agent operates autonomously, determining:

* Whether the query requires external information  
* What specific searches would be most valuable  
* How to integrate web-sourced information with document-based findings

The agentic workflow, while powerful, can be complex. For transparency and debugging, the system integrates with tools like LangFuse or LangFlow for workflow inspection and monitoring.

### **Layer 6: Reflection and Answer Completion**

Even with sophisticated retrieval and agentic workflows, complex queries might still receive incomplete answers. To address this, I implemented a reflection-based improvement mechanism.

After the initial response generation, a separate model evaluates whether the answer fully addresses all aspects of the user's query. If gaps are identified, the system:

1. Lists the missing information components  
2. Passes this analysis back to the agent along with the previous response  
3. Generates additional content to complete the answer

This reflection loop ensures comprehensive responses that truly satisfy the user's information needs.

## **System Performance and Impact**

The resulting system transforms hours of manual document analysis into seconds of intelligent information retrieval. Key benefits include:

**Speed**: Near-instantaneous responses to complex financial questions **Accuracy**: Grounded answers with direct document citations **Comprehensiveness**: Multi-layered approach ensures thorough coverage **Scalability**: Can process multiple companies and documents simultaneously **Transparency**: Clear audit trail of information sources and reasoning

## **Implementation Considerations and Lessons Learned**

### **Choosing Between Agentic and Reflection Approaches**

The system offers two primary enhancement strategies:

**Agentic Approach**: Provides maximum flexibility and can handle diverse, unpredictable query types. Best for scenarios requiring external data integration and complex reasoning chains.

**Reflection Approach**: Offers more predictable, systematic answer improvement. Ideal for ensuring completeness in document-based queries with well-defined information requirements.

The choice between these approaches depends on specific use cases, with many implementations benefiting from a hybrid strategy that employs both techniques appropriately.

## **Conclusion: Transforming Financial Analysis Through AI**

This RAG system represents a significant advancement in how fintech companies can leverage AI for document analysis. By combining sophisticated retrieval mechanisms, intelligent reranking, query decomposition, web integration, and reflection-based improvement, the system delivers accurate, comprehensive answers to complex financial questions.

The multi-layered architecture ensures that users receive not just quick answers, but thorough, grounded responses that can inform critical business decisions. As the fintech industry continues to evolve, tools like this will become essential for maintaining competitive advantage in an increasingly data-driven landscape.

The journey from manual document review to AI-powered analysis represents more than just technological advancement – it's a fundamental shift toward more intelligent, efficient, and scalable financial research methodologies that will define the future of fintech operations.
